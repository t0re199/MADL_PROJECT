# README #

This repository cointains application of **Machine and Deep Learning** tecniques on **images** and **texts**.   
Major Python's Machine Learning Libraries such as:   
* **NumPy**      
* **Scipy**   
* **Pandas**      
* **SkLearn**     
* **Matplotlib**      

and others have been used.  
Deep Learning models have been built by means of **TensorFlow**.   

## Images ##

Two tasks have been addressed: Multi-Class Classification and Anomaly Detection.   

### Multi-Class Classification ###
The following models have been used:   
* **Convlutional Neural Networks**      
* **SupportVector Machines**      
* **AdaBoost** with Decision Trees as weak learners.     
* **K-Nearest Neighbour**      
* **Categorical Naive Bayes**    

A classification on data at lower dimesnionality by means of **PCA** has been provided too.   


### Anomaly Detection ###
The following models have been used:   
* **One-Class SupportVector Machines**      
* **Variational AutoEncoder**   


## Texts ##

Two tasks have been addressed: Multi-Class Classification (in particular, a Sentiment Analisys) and Anomaly Detection.
